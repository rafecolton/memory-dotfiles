memory-dotfiles
===============

    Like your typical dotfiles repo, but more flexible and less obtrusive
    
The idea behind memory-dotfiles is to provide both some nice standard 
dotfiles and also an easy way to sub them in and out on any given system.
Essentially, a person should be able to use a system the way they'd like
for a while and then put it back how it was when they found it.

This process should be:

* unobtrusive
* flexible
* safe
* self-contained
* a good citizen (clean up after itself)
* easy
* simple

It is still just an idea (no code has been written yet), so we'll see how it goes.
